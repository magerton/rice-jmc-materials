<!-- Dear Recruiting Committee,

I write to apply for your open Assistant Professor position in the Economics department (ID 001995TT-2018-ECO-SPF50-49 and JOE ID 111458292).-->

I write to apply for your open Asstant Professor position (JOE ID 12345456).

I expect to graduate with a Ph.D. in Economics from Rice University in May 2018. My research fields include energy economics and applied econometrics, with a focus on dynamic problems.

In my job market paper, I study SOMETHING. To do this, I estimate SOMETHING.

This year I also published two papers in top field-journals (one solo-authored publication, and the other co-authored). I have a third paper under review following an offer to revise and resubmit. I have presented my work at numerous conferences and workshops was awarded my department's prize for something.

Informing public policy debates through research is important to me. To that end, I have published several policy pieces in affiliation with Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.

I have teaching experience at both the undergraduate and masters level. My teaching fields include labor, applied econometrics, applied numerical methods, and microeconomics. I was awarded a prize for this

In addition to the qualifications listed on my CV, I also speak Greek fluently and have lived in China and Turkey. I am a British citizen.

I look forward to speaking with you further about how I can contribute to research and teaching at your department.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
