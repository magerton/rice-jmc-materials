## General field and methodologies

My research to-date has been in the field of energy economics. The methods I use include dynamic optimization, computational and econometric methods for dynamic problems, and applied time-series econometrics. These are particularly useful tools to analyze the long-lived investment problems that characterize resource and electricity markets, as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation. Both my job-market paper and the second chapter of my dissertation demonstrate my comfort with the theory of dynamic optimization and the computational methods to solve and estimate such problems. I have taken three courses that focus on the theory and application of dynamic optimization techniques. I have audited a fourth course and participated in a year-long reading group about econometric estimation of dynamic games. Both of my publications involve applied time-series methods related to cointegration, structural breaks, and dynamic panels. <!-- I am particularly effective at communicating my results visually to an audience, which is most evident in my non-academic publications and presentations. **(Is the data-visualization relevant/appropriate? Data $\neq$ economics, but it can be helpful.)** -->
